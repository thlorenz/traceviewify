/**
 * @fileoverview Helper code for defining extension registries, which can be
 * used to make a part of trace-viewer extensible.
 *
 * This file provides two basic types of extension registries:
 * - Generic: register a type with metadata, query for those types based on
 *            a predicate
 *
 * - TypeName-based: register a type that handles some combination
 *                   of tracing categories or typeNames, then query
 *                   for it based on a category, typeName or both.
 *
 * Use these for pure-JS classes or ui.define'd classes. For polymer element
 * related registries, consult base/polymer_utils.html.
 *
 * When you register subtypes, you pass the constructor for the
 * subtype, and any metadata you want associated with the subtype. Use metadata
 * instead of stuffing fields onto the constructor. E.g.:
 *     registry.register(MySubclass, {titleWhenShownInTabStrip: 'MySub'})
 *
 * Some registries want a default object that is returned when a more precise
 * subtype has been registered. To provide one, set the defaultConstructor
 * option on the registry options.
 *
 * If you want to enforce that a registry only manages types of a given subtype,
 * then set mandatoryBaseType field on the registry.

/**

 * The basic idea used here is to fuse subpixel rectangles together so that
 * we never issue a canvas fillRect for them. It turns out Javascript can
 * do this quite efficiently, compared to asking Canvas2D to do the same.
 *
 * A few extra things are done by this class in the name of speed:
 * - Viewport culling: off-viewport rectangles are discarded.
 *
 * - The actual discarding operation is done in world space,
 *   e.g. pre-transform.
 *
 * - Rather than expending compute cycles trying to figure out an average
 *   color for fused rectangles from css strings, you instead draw using
 *   palletized colors. The fused rect color is choosen from the rectangle with
 *   the higher alpha value, if equal the max pallete index encountered.
 *

/**
 * @fileoverview Base class for linux perf event parsers.
 *
 * The linux perf trace event importer depends on subclasses of
 * Parser to parse event data.  Each subclass corresponds
 * to a group of trace events; e.g. SchedParser implements
 * parsing of sched:* kernel trace events.  Parser subclasses must
 * call Parser.register to arrange to be instantiated
 * and their constructor must register their event handlers with the
 * importer.  For example,
 *
 * var Parser = tv.e.importer.linux_perf.Parser;
 *
 * function WorkqueueParser(importer) {
 *   Parser.call(this, importer);
 *
 *   importer.registerEventHandler('workqueue_execute_start',
 *       WorkqueueParser.prototype.executeStartEvent.bind(this));
 *   importer.registerEventHandler('workqueue_execute_end',
 *       WorkqueueParser.prototype.executeEndEvent.bind(this));
 * }
 *
 * Parser.register(WorkqueueParser);
 *
 * When a registered event name is found in the data stream the associated
 * event handler is invoked:
 *
 *   executeStartEvent: function(eventName, cpuNumber, ts, eventBase)
 *
 * If the routine returns false the caller will generate an import error
 * saying there was a problem parsing it.  Handlers can also emit import
 * messages using this.importer.model.importWarning.  If this is done in lieu of
 * the generic import error it may be desirable for the handler to return
 * true.
 *
 * Trace events generated by writing to the trace_marker file are expected
 * to have a leading text marker followed by a ':'; e.g. the trace clock
 * synchronization event is:
 *
 *  tracing_mark_write: trace_event_clock_sync: parent_ts=0
 *
 * To register an event handler for these events, prepend the marker with
 * 'tracing_mark_write:'; e.g.
 *
 *    this.registerEventHandler('tracing_mark_write:trace_event_clock_sync',
 *
 * All subclasses should depend on importer.linux_perf.parser, e.g.
 *
 * tv.defineModule('importer.linux_perf.workqueue_parser')
 *   .dependsOn('importer.linux_perf.parser')
 *   .exportsTo('tracing', function()
 *
 * and be listed in the dependsOn of LinuxPerfImporter.  Beware that after
 * adding a new subclass you must run build/generate_about_tracing_contents.py
 * to regenerate tv.e.about_tracing.*.

/**
 * @fileoverview Base class for Windows ETW event parsers.
 *
 * The ETW trace event importer depends on subclasses of
 * Parser to parse event data.  Each subclass corresponds
 * to a group of trace events; e.g. Thread and Process implements
 * decoding of scheduling events.  Parser subclasses must
 * call Parser.register to arrange to be instantiated
 * and their constructor must register their event handlers with the
 * importer.  For example,
 *
 * var Parser = tv.e.importer.etw.Parser;
 *
 * function ThreadParser(importer) {
 *   Parser.call(this, importer);
 *
 *   importer.registerEventHandler(guid, kThreadStartOpcode,
 *       ThreadParser.prototype.decodeStart.bind(this));
 *   importer.registerEventHandler(guid, kThreadEndOpcode,
 *       ThreadParser.prototype.decodeEnd.bind(this));
 * }
 *
 * Parser.register(ThreadParser);
 *
 * When a registered event is found, the associated event handler is invoked:
 *
 *   decodeStart: function(header, decoder) {
 *     [...]
 *     return true;
 *   },
 *
 * If the routine returns false the caller will generate an import error
 * saying there was a problem parsing it.  Handlers can also emit import
 * messages using this.importer.model.importWarning.  If this is done in lieu of
 * the generic import error it may be desirable for the handler to return
 * true.
